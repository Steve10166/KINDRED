# kindred
'never one, without a kind companion'

With a venv set up, run main.py in the src/KINDRED directory.
Outside of Emora stdm, Kindred is ran on commonly used packages. Refer to the import list found in the beginning of main.py for complete list of imports.


**
A file called pip_installs.txt was created during testing as well. Those are the pip installs that I did locally but did not end up using for Kindred. 
If Kindred does not run, try to pip install those as well and try again (although I doubt that'll help...)
